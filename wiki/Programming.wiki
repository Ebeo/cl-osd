#summary Programming cl-osd onto board.

= Programmer = 

You need a AVR programmer in order to program the chip on the board.
There are several different types of programmers and in this case I will focus on USBASP since that's what I use and it's cheap.

= Soldering =

There are six pads on the boards that you need to either solder cables to or add a socket to.

The pitch of the pads are 2.0 mm which means that we need a special socket that has 2.0 mm pitch. If you don't have those at hand you can use a normal 2.45 mm pitch socket as Parity has done here:

Then you can use some sort of jumper cable sutch as these:

= Connecting board and programmer =

Now it's time to connect the board with the programmer.
Connect each of the cables together with jumper cables according to the following images:

== AVR ISP programming header ==

*Note that this pinout is for the header and not the cable.* 
Just to make everything a bit more complicated. I could not find a pinout image for the cable.

See below for the difference a between the cable and the header:
